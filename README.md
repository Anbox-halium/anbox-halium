# Waydroid

Waydroid uses a container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a
regular GNU/Linux systems as well as PostmarketOS.

## Overview

Waydroid uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a
full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on
any GNU/Linux-based platform.

The Android system inside the container has direct access to any needed hardware.

The Android runtime environment ships with a minimal customized Android system
image based on [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/). The image is currently based
on Android 11.
